# Menu Maker

This is development code, if you weren't sent here to look at it then you don't need it.

## Express on Heroku

This repo has been setup to run in prod mode on heroku, but it is in no way secure or recommended for public use. To run it with ng instead of express you must change the package.json start parameter to reflect which one you want. If you don't know how to do that, then you probably don't want to do that.

## The following is auto generated and may not be accurate instructions


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
